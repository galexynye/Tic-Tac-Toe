# Tic-Tac-Toe

**Tic-Tac-Toe AI made with Vanilla JS.**

This was my first project working sans library or framework (except animateCss) and I enjoyed using Vanilla Javascript. 

The basis for the AI is to check the possible winning combinations first for 2 in a row, then 1 in a row matches of the computer then the player, and then
choose and either to have the computer win or block the player.
